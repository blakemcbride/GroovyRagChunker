# Groovy Chunker for RAG

This code breaks a Groovy source file into reasonable chunks that would
be needed by a RAG system.

It uses a build system written by Blake McBride.

To build and run:

./bld run <groovy-source-file>

The code for this is at:  https://github.com/blakemcbride/GroovyRAGChunker
